/*6. Constructor with Validation

Write a Java program to create a class called Account with instance variables accountNumber and balance. 
Implement a parameterized constructor that initializes these variables with validation:
accountNumber should be non-null and non-empty.
balance should be non-negative.
Print an error message if the validation fails.
